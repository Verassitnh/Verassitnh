### Hey Friends ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Jackson. I am a homeschooled high school student. I am a reader, coder, aspiring entrepreneur, and a child of God. I love to be productive, to be helpful, to give, and to get stuff done. I like to study, work, eat, read, live, and run. My day generally starts at 5AM and ends at 8PM. Every day I spend 2 hours of my time participating in productive recreation. My pleasure reading generally consists of historical fiction or historical non-fiction.
